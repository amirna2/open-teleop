# Revised Project Plan for Open-Teleop

For a minimal viable implementation of this robotics teleoperation platform, I will focus on these core components in a more incremental approach:

## Core Components (In Priority Order)

### 1. Container A: ROS2 Bridge (Minimal Set)
- **diagnostic_bridge**: System monitoring (CPU, Memory, ROS node status)
- **teleop_command_bridge**: Required to send basic movement commands to the robot
- Simplified launch file for these bridges
- Basic Dockerfile to build this container

### 2. Container B: Go Controller (Minimal Set)
- Main application structure: Basic HTTP server setup using Fiber
- Diagnostic service: System monitoring dashboard and API
- Teleop service: Basic command handling
- Configuration manager: Simple configuration loading
- Dockerfile for the Go controller

### 3. Infrastructure
- Simple docker-compose.yml to orchestrate both containers
- Basic networking between containers

### 4. Testing
- Basic test for diagnostics reporting
- Basic test for teleop commands
- Integration test to verify end-to-end communication

## Revised Development Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup (Complete)
- Create directory structure
- Initialize Go module
- Set up ROS2 workspace

### Phase 2: Implement Diagnostics (First Milestone)
- Create diagnostic_bridge ROS2 node to collect system metrics
- Implement diagnostic service in Go controller
- Establish bridge<->service communication pattern
- Create simple dashboard for metrics visualization

### Phase 3: Implement Teleop (Second Milestone)
- Create teleop_command_bridge ROS2 node
- Implement teleop service in Go controller
- Create simple interface for sending commands
- Test with basic robot control

### Phase 4: Container and Orchestration
- Dockerfiles for both containers
- Docker Compose for local development
- Ensure proper communication between containers

### Phase 5: Basic Testing and Verification
- Confirm diagnostics reporting works
- Confirm teleop commands reach the robot
- Test with simple robot simulator if no physical robot available

### Future Phases (Post-MVP)
- Video streaming with WebRTC (more complex)
- Audio communication
- Sensor data visualization
- Navigation planning
- Multi-robot support

## Rationale for Revised Approach

This revised approach provides several benefits:
1. **Lower Initial Complexity**: Starting with diagnostics establishes the foundation without the complexity of video streaming
2. **Faster Time to Value**: Get a working system more quickly with basic functionality
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Identify architecture issues early with simpler components
4. **Clear Progression**: Each phase builds directly on the previous one

Video streaming is deferred to a future phase as it involves more complexity with WebRTC, signaling servers, and media handling. By building the system incrementally, we'll have a more solid foundation when we add these advanced features.

## ROS Gateway Implementation Plan

### 1. Project Setup (Week 1)

1. **Create the Package Structure**
   - Create a new ROS2 package in `ros2_ws/src` named `ros_gateway`
   - Set up Python package structure with proper CMake and package.xml
   - Create necessary dependencies on ROS2 (humble/iron) and ZeroMQ

2. **Define Configuration Format**
   - Create a YAML-based configuration schema for topic mappings
   - Define the relationship between ROS topics and OTT identifiers
   - Include priority settings, topic types, and other parameters

### 2. Core Components Implementation (Weeks 2-3)

1. **Config Processor**
   - Implement YAML config loader
   - Create validation functions for config integrity
   - Set up dynamic reloading capability

2. **Topic Subscriber**
   - Implement dynamic topic subscription based on config
   - Create a generic message handler framework
   - Build subscription lifecycle management (connect, disconnect, reconnect)

3. **Message Converter**
   - Implement serialization for ROS message → OttMessage
   - Create priority assignment logic
   - Add timestamp and metadata handling

4. **ZeroMQ Client**
   - Set up ZeroMQ PUB-SUB pattern for controller communication
   - Implement serialization of OttMessages using FlatBuffers
   - Add connection management and backpressure handling

5. **Topic Publisher**
   - Create subscriber for receiving commands from controller
   - Implement deserialization and type conversion
   - Set up ROS publishers for sending commands to robot

### 3. Testing Infrastructure (Week 4)

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write tests for each component
   - Create mock ROS topics for testing
   - Test message conversion accuracy

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test end-to-end message flow
   - Verify compatibility with the controller
   - Test priority-based processing

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Measure message throughput
   - Evaluate latency under different loads
   - Identify bottlenecks

### 4. Documentation and Deployment (Week 5)

1. **Documentation**
   - Create detailed API documentation
   - Write configuration guides
   - Document message flow and integration points

2. **Containerization**
   - Create Docker image for deployment
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure container orchestration

3. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Add logging infrastructure
   - Implement metrics collection
   - Create health checks

   ## Implementation Summary and Next Steps

Based on the architecture document and diagram, I've created a foundation for implementing the ROS Gateway (formerly "Universal Bridge"). Here's a summary of what we've accomplished and what's next:

### Accomplished

1. **Renamed to "ROS Gateway"** - A more descriptive name that clearly indicates the component's role as the gateway between ROS and the teleop system.

2. **Created basic package structure**:
   - ROS2 package setup with proper dependencies
   - Configuration management system
   - Main entry point with proper lifecycle handling
   - Launch file for easy deployment

3. **Defined core components**:
   - Config Processor for loading and validating configurations
   - Structure for Topic Subscriber, Message Converter, ZeroMQ Client, and Topic Publisher
   - Clear separation of concerns between components

4. **Configuration format**:
   - YAML-based configuration with validation
   - Topic mappings between ROS and OTT identifiers
   - Priority and direction settings

### Next Steps

1. **Implement core functional components**:
   - Complete the ZeroMQ Client for controller communication
   - Develop the Message Converter for ROS ↔ OttMessage conversion
   - Build the Topic Manager/Subscriber for dynamic topic handling
   - Create the Topic Publisher for sending commands to ROS

2. **Integration with FlatBuffers**:
   - Integrate the FlatBuffers schema for OttMessage
   - Implement serialization/deserialization

3. **Testing infrastructure**:
   - Build unit tests for each component
   - Create integration tests for end-to-end validation
   - Performance testing for high-throughput scenarios

4. **Deployment and monitoring**:
   - Containerization with Docker
   - Metrics collection and health checks
   - CI/CD pipeline integration

### Development Timeline

- **Week 1**: Finish implementing remaining core components
- **Week 2**: Integration with controller and testing
- **Week 3**: Performance optimization and documentation
- **Week 4**: Deployment infrastructure and CI/CD

The ROS Gateway design follows the architecture document's principles, providing a flexible, configuration-driven bridge between ROS and the Open-Teleop controller, while maintaining proper separation of concerns and dynamic topic handling capabilities.
